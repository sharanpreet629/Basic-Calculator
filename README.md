<h2>Basic Calculator</h2>
This is basic calculator program which performs arithmetic operations on numbers like Addition, Subtraction, Division, Exponential, Multiplication, Modulus. Two numbers are taken as an input and one more input to choose operator (according to need of arithmetic output). Then using if-else statements and user defined functions we calculate the arithmetic output  and then we display these results in a list so that we can get required output in a single row.
